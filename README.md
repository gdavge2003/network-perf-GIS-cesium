# network-perf-GIS-cesium

Front-end of GIS built on CesiumJS to display telecommunication data (SNR, RSRP) in a multi-dimensional visualization that offers insight for engineering and business decisions. This is the primary project that was developed during my internship at T-mobile as a full-stack developer.

Sensitive data has been removed, so src will NOT run as-is. The repository is meant to showcase as an example the ways CesiumJS can be used to build a powerful and robust GIS from the ground up.

Back-end data processing was done separately using Python and PostgreSQL.
